Gimmiea
===========

Gimmiea is an open, public API that allows you to grab or generate simple, routine things quickly and via a RESTful API. Gimmiea was created in service of the ideal of "Voltron", an application which can be built solely from APIs. 

The app is dead; long live the API.

## Etc

Gimmiea is written in Ruby and uses Sinatra and Thin. It is currently deployed on Heroku.
