Just Do It.
Because life is not a spectator sport. 
Part of the fabric of life.
Push through the pain.
The legend rolls on.
The way it should be.
Beyond the conventional.
Safety.
Think small.
Life’s a journey. Enjoy the ride. 
Because I’m worth it.
Maybe she’s born with it...
Feel like a woman.
Dangerously entertaining. 
Oh, the possibilities.
It’s something to do with your brain.
Live in your world, play in ours.
I don’t want to grow up...
Head for the border
We love to see you smile. 
We keep your promise.
Be absolutely sure.
Neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
I’m lovin’ it.
Be bullish.
We make money the old fashioned way...we earn it.
Turning dreams into reality.
Membership has its privileges. Don’t leave home without it.
There are some things money can’t buy. For everything else, there’s Mastercard.
You’re in good hands.
Like a good neighbor...
See what you’re missing.
Think different.
Think random.
Be all that you can be.
The Sky’s the limit.
Have it your way.
You deserve a break today. - Do you believe in magic?
Eat Fresh.
What you crave.
Sometimes you have to break the rules.
Think outside the bun
It’s better here.
Obey your thirst.
Melts in your mouth not in your hands.
Is it in you?
Life tastes good.
Life’s Good
We bring good things to life.
Can you hear me now?
Let’s make things better.
Connecting people.
It keeps going, and going, and going...
It’s all inside.
Be the first to know.
That was easy.
The happiest place in the world.
Do the dew.
When you care enough to send the very best.
